# uStepperGUI - Interface for uStepperS driver

This repository contains a graphical user interface for the uStepperS platform. The GUI is hosted on the WiFi-shield available for uStepperS which is based on the ESP8285. The repository contains two Arduino sketches, one for the uStepper (uStepperGUI.ino) and one for the WiFi shield (uStepperWiFi.ino). After the firmware has been written to both modules, a local WiFI network called "uStepperGUI" is created, and the graphical interface can be accessed through a webbrowser on the address: 192.168.4.1.
